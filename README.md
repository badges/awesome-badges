### Raster badges

> SVG badges are encouraged because they render better on Retina displays and
> scale up beautifully. However in a few environments, such as Slack and HTML
> email, SVG images won't render, so PNG badges are preferred. Shields offers
> raster badges through its raster server, `raster.shields.io`.
